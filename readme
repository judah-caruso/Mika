# MIKA # -- Block Header (used for main areas of text)
    -> Introduction:
        Mika is a general purpose markup language designed to be simplistic and
        easy to read while being highly structured.
    -> Basics of Mika:
        Mika documents (.mika) start with a main header [# HEADER #], follwed by
        Sub-headers [-> Arrow Lines]. The information nested under an Arrow Line
        is the text/main body of our document. We're able to format it with 
        several `implicatives`. These include:
            1. _Underlines_
            2. *Bolds*
            3. `Italics`
            4. [Blocks]
        However, Mika has a few more features that this document will introduce.

        -> Implicative:
            _Underlined_ -- Underlined text
            _This text spans
            multiple lines!_ -- Underlined text can span multiple lines
            *Bold Text* -- Bolded text
            `Italic Text` -- Italic text
            [Block Text] -- Blocked/Separated text (similar to underlining)
            ;;Multi-line 
            blocks. Used for 
            formatted data;; -- Multi-line block (aka: a "Writer's block")

    @ RULES AND BEST PRACTICES @ -- AT Header (can be used stylistically)
        Generally, Mika doesn't impose anything in terms of *how* to edit.
        However, there are a few best practices to follow/reference when
        writing with Mika:
            1. Headers must be completely capitalized and can be nested.
            If a header is nested, it's best to swap out the header's type:
                # FIRST HEADER # -- Top level
                    ! SECOND HEADER ! -- First nesting
                        @ THIRD HEADER @  -- Second nesting
            2. Arrow lines are a single tab-length ahead of main headers.
            3. Arrow lines should generally end with a colon (:) unless it is 
            unwanted stylistically.
            4. Writer's blocks can either be "Expaned" or "Compact":
                Expanded:
                    ;;
                        This is the expanded form of a writer's block.
                        You would use this for a snippet of code, haiku, etc... 
                        Notice the 4 space characters leading each line inside 
                        this block. This is a stylistic choice to improve the
                        readability of content inside these blocks.
                    ;;
                Compact:
                    ;;This is the compact form
                    of a Writer's block. Used when style isn't very important;;
                If neither form fits, use a [Block] instead.
            5. Each line should contain no more than 80 characters. This is one
            of the only inforced rules in Mika.

    ! CLOSING !
        In closing, Mika allows you to minimally format documents in ways that
        already make sense. Underlines are underlines, blocks are blocks, etc.
